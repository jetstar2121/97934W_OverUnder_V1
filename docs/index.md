# About
JAR-Template is a simple and powerful VexCode library featuring PID, odometry, and custom motion algorithms. 

## Installation
1. Download the project by downloading the .zip file [here](https://github.com/2775Josh/JAR-Template/releases/latest).

2. Extract the zipped file (perhaps to a folder such as documents, or vexcode-projects).

3. Open the project in VexCode by choosing "Open" (not "Import") from the file menu and selecting the JAR-Template.v5code file.

4. First configure your robot using the graphical configurer, then follow the instructions in main.cpp to configure the template to your robot specs.
